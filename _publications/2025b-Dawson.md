excerpt: 'We introduce a frequency-domain method for estimating radar attenuation rates in ice sheets, adapted from the spectral ratio technique in seismology. The approach works where traditional methods fail, such as in regions with uniform ice thickness or disrupted internal layers, and produces results that align with borehole temperature-based estimates. This expands the spatial coverage of reliable attenuation measurements, enabling improved ice sheet temperature mapping.'
