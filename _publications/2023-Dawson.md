excerpt: 'This paper examines the vulnerability of East Antarctica’s Adélie-George V Land, focusing on the Wilkes Subglacial Basin, to ice sheet instability. Using a new statistical method to analyze airborne radar sounding data, the study identifies mixed frozen and thawed bed conditions near the grounding zone. These findings suggest that the region may be more susceptible to climate-driven retreat and mass loss than previously thought, due to the potential ease of ice flow over areas that are near thawing.'
