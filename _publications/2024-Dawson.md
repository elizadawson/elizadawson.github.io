excerpt: 'This study assesses the vulnerability of East Antarctica’s Adélie–George V Land by analyzing airborne radar sounding data with a new statistical method. Results reveal a mix of frozen and thawed bed conditions near the Wilkes Subglacial Basin grounding zone, indicating that the region may be more prone to climate-driven retreat and ice mass loss than previously recognized.'
