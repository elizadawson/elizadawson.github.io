excerpt: 'Radar attenuation controls how deeply and clearly radio waves probe ice on Earth and across the solar system. This review synthesizes decades of work on the physical origins of electromagnetic energy loss in ice, linking dielectric theory, laboratory measurements, and radar observations across glaciology and planetary science. By unifying previously separate approaches within a single physical framework, it clarifies how temperature, impurities, frequency, and structure govern attenuation and how methodological choices shape radar interpretation from ice sheets to icy moons.'
