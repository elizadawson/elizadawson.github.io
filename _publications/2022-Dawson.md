title: "Ice mass loss sensitivity to the Antarctic ice sheet basal thermal state"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: '/publication/2022-Dawson'
excerpt: 'In this paper, we examine how thawing at the base of the Antarctic ice sheet could lead to significant ice mass loss and contribute to sea-level rise, particularly in previously considered stable regions of East Antarctica. Using numerical model projections, the study highlights that areas like the Wilkes Basin could become major contributors to sea-level rise if basal thawing occurs, challenging the focus on West Antarctica.'
