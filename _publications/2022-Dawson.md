excerpt: 'This study shows that thawing at the base of the Antarctic ice sheet could greatly accelerate ice mass loss, even in regions long considered stable. Numerical modeling reveals that areas such as the Wilkes Basin in East Antarctica may become major sources of sea-level rise if basal thawing reduces friction at the iceâ€“bed interface, underscoring the importance of basal thermal state in future projections.'
