I have contributed to undergraduate, graduate, and field-based geoscience education across multiple institutions. As a teaching assistant, I have supported lectures and led practical sessions on radar, seismic, gravity, and magnetic methods. I also taught in the the field in challenging environments ranging from the dessert to the arctic. I also seek out opportunities to bolster teaching resources. During my PhD at Stanford, I served as a Graduate Teaching Liaison, leading pedagogy workshops, mentoring new TAs, and fostering inclusive classroom culture. These experiences shaped my focus on hands-on learning, peer-to-peer engagement, and mentoring students as they connect classroom learnings with real-world problems.

## Field Geophysics Instruction in the Mojave Desert

As a teaching assistant for Stanford’s undergraduate introduction to geophysics course, I taught students how to conduct radar, gravity, and magnetic surveys in California’s Mojave Desert, guiding them through data acquisition, processing, and interpretation.

## Arctic Geophysics Teaching at UNIS, Svalbard

I taught in the Arctic Geophysics Course at the University Centre in Svalbard, Norway (UNIS), introducing students to radar surveying with ground and UAV systems and assisting with active seismic work across a glacier.
