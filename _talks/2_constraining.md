    Radar sounding provides the only continent scale view of the ice sheet subsurface, from internal layering to the ice base. I develop methods to extract physical information about ice properties, including ice temperature and subglacial water, from radar datasets. My <a href="/publications/#publication-2024-Dawson">work in <em>Geophysical Research Letters<em></a>, classifies frozen and thawed bed conditions beneath the outflow of Wilkes Subglacial Basin, producing a novel radar-derived thermal state assessment for a region central to East Antarctica stability. I also estimate ice sheet <a href="/publications/#publication-2026-Dawson">englacial temperature from radar echoes</a> across large regions of Antarctica and Greenland, providing a comparison to borehole measurements, model output, and other geophysical estimates.

    Turning observations into model ready constraints
  </h2>

  <p>
    A key challenge in glaciology is converting geophysical observations into quantitative constraints that ice flow models can use, especially for basal and englacial conditions that are rarely measured directly. My approach is to develop inversion and probabilistic frameworks that translate geophysical measurements into model inputs, including basal friction and thermal state, and use that to quantify what is strongly constrained by data and what remains most uncertain.

    I use process based modeling to test how sensitive ice loss is to poorly observed englacial and subglacial conditions and to identify which measurements will most reduce projection uncertainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research in <a href="/publications/#publication-2022-Dawson"><em>Nature Communications</em></a> used numerical modeling to show that small amounts of thawing at the base of the ice sheet in near melt regions could greatly reduce basal friction and increase ice discharge in parts of East Antarctica often treated as stable. This links basal thermal conditions to future ice loss vulnerability and identifies regions where observations are most needed. This is an important finding because leading ice sheet models used for future sea level rise projections have entirely different basal thermal state representations. This means ice sheet model projections are not resolving ice loss mechanisms related to the basal thermal state.

  <p>
    Ice sheets respond to both internal physical changes and external forcing. I work with oceanographers and climate scientists to connect basal state and ice shelf melt to the ocean and atmospheric drivers that control heat transport towards Earth's ice sheets, using geophysical constraints to guide idealized and targeted modeling. This connects subsurface observations to the external forcing that ultimately drives mass loss.
