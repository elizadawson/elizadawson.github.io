    A key challenge in ice sheet science is converting geophysical observations into quantitative constraints that ice flow models can use, especially for basal and englacial conditions that are rarely measured directly. My approach is to develop inversion and probabilistic frameworks that translate geophysical measurements into model inputs, including basal friction and thermal state, and use that to quantify what is strongly constrained by data and what remains most uncertain.
