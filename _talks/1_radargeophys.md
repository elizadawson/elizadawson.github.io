  <p>
    Radar sounding provides the only continent scale view of the ice sheet subsurface, from internal layering to the ice bed. I develop methods to extract physical information about ice properties including ice temperature and subglacial water from radar datasets. For example, I built a statistical framework to classify <a href="/publications/#publication-2024-Dawson">frozen and thawed bed conditions</a> beneath the Wilkes Subglacial Basin outflow, including confidence for each classification, producing a novel radar based thermal state assessment for a region central to East Antarctica stability. I also derive attenuation constraints from radar echo power that can be compared with borehole, model output, and other geophysical estimates.

    Turning observations into model ready constraints
  </h2>

  <p>
    A key challenge in glaciology is converting geophysical observations into quantitative constraints that ice flow models can use, especially for basal and englacial conditions that are rarely measured directly. My approach is to develop inversion and probabilistic frameworks that translate geophysical measurements into model inputs, including basal friction and thermal state, and use that to quantify what is strongly constrained by data and what remains most uncertain.

    I use process based modeling to test how sensitive ice loss is to poorly observed basal conditions and to identify which measurements will most reduce projection uncertainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research in<a href="/publications/#publication-2022-Dawson"><em>Nature Communications</em></a> used ISSM to show that modest basal warming in near melt regions can greatly reduce basal friction and increase ice discharge in parts of East Antarctica often treated as stable. This links basal thermal constraints to where future ice loss can accelerate and helps identify regions where observations are most needed.

  <p>
    Ice sheets respond to both internal physical changes and external forcing. I work with oceanographers and climate scientists to connect basal state and ice shelf melt to the ocean and atmospheric drivers that control heat transport towards Earth's ice sheets, using geophysical constraints to guide idealized and targeted modeling. This connects subsurface observations to the external forcing that ultimately drives mass loss.
