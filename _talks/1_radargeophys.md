  <p>
    I use process based modeling to test how sensitive ice loss is to poorly observed englacial and subglacial conditions and to identify which measurements will most reduce projection uncertainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research in <a href="/publications/#publication-2022-Dawson"><em>Nature Communications</em></a> used numerical modeling to show that small amounts of thawing at the base of the ice sheet in near melt regions could greatly reduce basal friction and increase ice discharge in parts of East Antarctica often treated as stable. This links basal thermal conditions to future ice loss vulnerability and identifies regions where observations are most needed. 
  </p>

  <p>
    This is an important finding because leading ice sheet models used for future sea level rise projections have widely varying basal temperature fields. This implies that ice sheet model projections are not doing a good job of resolving the basal thermal state and therefore projections do not include ice loss related to basal thermal state mechanisms.

    A key challenge in glaciology is converting geophysical observations into quantitative constraints that ice flow models can use, especially for basal and englacial conditions that are rarely measured directly. My approach is to focus on extracting more physical information about ice properties, including ice temperature and subglacial water, directly from geophysical datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fortunately there are extensive radar sounding datasets across the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets and radar sounding data is sensitive to internal layering all the way to the base of the ice sheet, even in parts of Antarctica where there is ice over 4 km thick. 
  </p>

  <p>    
    I apply a range of methods, ranging from geophysical to statistical and machine learning techniques, to extract more physical information from radar sounding datasets, and where no method is available, I design new methods to extract more from radar data. 
  </p>

  <p>    
    My <a href="/publications/#publication-2024-Dawson">work in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em></a> classifies frozen and thawed bed conditions beneath the outflow of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin, producing a novel radar derived thermal state assessment for a region central to East Antarctica stability. I also estimate ice sheet <a href="/publications/#publication-2026-Dawson">englacial temperature from radar echoes</a> across large regions of the Antarctic and Greenland interior, providing a comparison to borehole measurements, model output, and other geophysical estimates.

  <p>
    With better data products for englacial and subglacial conditions, this then poses the challenge of integrating this information directly into ice sheet models. Current ice sheet model data assimilation methods consist of using surface observations, such as surface velocity, to initialize ice sheet model simulations. My approach is to develop inversion and probabilistic frameworks that directly use subglacial geophysical measurements for model initialization. This could also include new parameterizations for better resolved subglacial feedback mechanisms.

    Growing geophysical imaging demands
  </h2>

  <p>
    As ice sheet model geophysical integration capabilities increase, this will drive higher geophysical data demands. I believe the most promising approach is to combine existing large-scale radar sounding surveys, with new targeted field campaigns to fill in radar measurements and pair with other geophysical datasets, such as borehole observations, radiometers, and seismic imaging. This will ensure continuous estimates of subsurface properties in the most important regions for understanding ice sheet dynamics and potential contribution to sea level rise.

  Informing and improving future projections
</h2>

<div style="font-size: 0.85em; margin-top: 0.5em;">

  <p>
    There is a productive tension between refining projections within existing modeling frameworks and asking whether key physics is absent from those frameworks. I try to do both in my work, considering unaccounted for mechanisms such as basal thaw driven mass loss, while developing geophysics based constraints that can be directly used to help ice sheet model inter-comparison efforts reduce uncertainty in future projections.
  </p>

  <p>
    Part of this is also recognizing that we are dealing with a complex system. Ice sheets are continually responding to both internal dynamics and external forcing, which are operating on a wide range of temporal and spatial timescales. I work with oceanographers and climate scientists to connect basal state and ice shelf melt to the ocean and atmospheric drivers that control heat transport towards Earth's ice sheet margins, using geophysical constraints to guide idealized and targeted modeling. This connects subsurface observations to both external and internal drivers, ultimately making future mass loss less nebulous and more grounded in observation and system scale understanding.
