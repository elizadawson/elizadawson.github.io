I believe that future breakthroughs in understanding cryospheric change will come from integrating methodologies and scientific approaches across disciplines. However, within the field of glaciology, observations and modeling studies are typically conducted by separate groups. Furthermore, there is little crossover between glaciologists, oceanographers, and climate scientists in the greater polar geoscience community.

My research challenges these divisions. My current focus is developing novel ways to combine ice sheet models and geophysical observations to unlock greater insights about the Antarctic ice sheet subsurface, work that has been awarded grants from both [NOAA](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc/class-34) and the NSF. As part of this effort, I am working with planetary radio science experts to better constrain terrestrial radioglaciology problems. At Stanford, my research extended beyond the Geophysics Department, as I collaborated with oceanography professor Earle Wilson to investigate connections between Southern Ocean forcing and vulnerable regions of the East Antarctic ice sheet. Furthermore, my undergraduate education is in Atmospheric Science, which included research in arctic climatology. My past and present research experiences have shown that interdisciplinary research can lead to scientific breakthroughs and is therefore a core principle of my approach to research.
