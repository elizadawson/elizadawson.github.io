Breakthroughs in understanding cryospheric change will come from integrating methodologies across disciplines. However, in glaciology, observational and modeling studies often occur in isolation, and there are inadequate crossovers between glaciologists, oceanographers, and climate scientists.

My research challenges these divisions. With my background in glaciology, geophysics, and climate science, I apply this broad knowledge to develop new methods that combine ice sheet models and geophysical observations, work that has been funded by [NOAA](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc/class-34) and the NSF. I also collaborate with planetary radio science experts to address terrestrial radioglaciology challenges, and I work with oceanographers to explore the interactions between Southern Ocean forcing and the stability of the Antarctic ice sheet. Additionally, my undergraduate work in Atmospheric Science included Arctic climatology research. My interdisciplinary approach drives innovation in understanding ice sheet dynamics and the broader impacts of climate change.
