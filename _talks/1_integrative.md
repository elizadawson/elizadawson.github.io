    <p>My work focuses on developing tools that extract deeper physical insight from geophysical observations—insight that can be directly incorporated into numerical models to reduce uncertainty in complex, poorly constrained ice processes. For example, I recently created a new approach for estimating radar attenuation and ice temperature, adapted from seismology, that expands where and how physical properties can be derived from radar data.</p>

    <p>Connecting communities across disciplines is also central to my approach. One example is a review paper I am leading that unifies Earth and planetary perspectives on radar attenuation to establish a shared physical framework. Despite significant technical overlap, these fields rarely interact, and this effort draws from both glaciological and planetary radar communities to highlight common challenges and opportunities across icy worlds.</p>

    <p>Across all of my work, I pursue a systems-level approach to understanding ice sheet change, integrating surface, basal, and margin processes with external climate drivers. Collaborations with planetary radar scientists and oceanographers support this effort, connecting radar signal behavior, ice–ocean interaction, and broader climate dynamics. My background in atmospheric science also informs this interdisciplinary perspective, from Arctic climatology to Antarctic mass loss.</p>
