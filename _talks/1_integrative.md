    <p>One of my current research directions involves developing a new approach for estimating radar attenuation through ice, expanding the ability to infer thermal structure and basal conditions even where traditional radar analysis falls short. This work leverages techniques from seismology and highlights the power of crossing disciplinary boundaries to unlock new types of geophysical insight.</p>

    <p>In parallel, I am leading a review paper aimed at unifying Earth and planetary perspectives on radar attenuation, helping to establish a shared physical framework across disciplines that are technically aligned but often disconnected. This effort draws from both glaciological and planetary radar communities and highlights the need for common tools and theory across icy worlds.</p>

    <p>Across all of my work, I pursue a systems-oriented approach to understanding ice sheet changeâ€”combining observations and models to trace how processes at the surface, base, and margins interact with external climate forcing. Collaborations with planetary radar scientists help address shared challenges in radar signal interpretation through ice, while joint work with oceanographers links ocean variability to ice sheet stability. My foundation in atmospheric science also contributes to this integrative perspective, from Arctic climatology to Antarctic mass loss.</p>
