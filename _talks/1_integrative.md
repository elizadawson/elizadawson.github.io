    <p>I turn geophysical observations into model-ready constraints to improve predictions of ice sheet behavior and reduce uncertainty in poorly understood processes. My work often adapts techniques from other fields to answer glaciological questions. For example, I introduced a spectral analysis method from seismology to radar sounding, using the full radar frequency spectrum to estimate ice temperature in its first application to this setting.</p>

   <p>Connecting ideas across disciplines is a central theme as well. I am leading a synthesis that unites Earth and planetary perspectives on radar attenuation in ice within a shared physical framework. These communities face similar technical challenges but have developed in parallel. Identifying common needs and opportunities across icy worlds is helping bring them together.</p>
   
   <p>I take a systems view of ice sheet change, linking surface, basal, and margin processes with external climate drivers. I collaborate with oceanographers to connect radar observations to iceâ€“ocean interactions, and my atmospheric science background informs how I consider climate forcing as a driver of cryosphere change.</p>
