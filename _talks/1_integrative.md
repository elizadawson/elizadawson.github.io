    <p>My work develops new tools to turn geophysical observations into model-ready constraints, advancing predictions of ice sheet behavior and reducing uncertainty in poorly understood processes. This often involves borrowing and adapting methods from other fields to answer glaciological questions. For example, I applied a spectral analysis technique from seismology to harness the full radar frequency spectrum for estimating ice temperature, marking its first application in radar sounding.</p>

    <p>Bridging communities and ideas across disciplines is central to my work. I am currently leading a synthesis that brings together Earth and planetary perspectives on radar attenuation into a shared physical framework. Although these fields face similar technical challenges, the communities rarely interact. This work draws on both glaciological and planetary radar expertise to identify common needs and opportunities across icy worlds.</p>

    <p>I take a systems-level view of ice sheet change, linking surface, basal, and margin processes with external climate drivers. Collaborations with planetary radar scientists and oceanographers connect radar signal behavior and iceâ€“ocean interactions, while my atmospheric science background informs my climate perspective from Arctic energy budgets to Antarctic ice sheet mass loss.</p>
