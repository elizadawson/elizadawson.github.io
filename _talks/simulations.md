A focus of my research is using numerical models to simulate the dynamics of ice sheets. 
Ice sheet models are a powerful tool for gaining insight about the future. These simulations are essential for understanding how ice sheets might respond to various environmental factors, including climate change.

For instance, my work with the Ice-Sheet and Sea-Level System Model (ISSM) has uncovered a potential vulnerability of the Antarctic ice sheet due to climate warmingâ€”the impact of thawing at the ice-bed interface on ice-sheet mass loss. In regions where the bed is currently frozen but close to thawing, even a slight increase in basal temperature could significantly reduce basal friction, leading to additional mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet.
