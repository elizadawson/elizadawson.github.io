    <p>I use numerical models to simulate ice sheet dynamics, providing a way to test how ice sheets regions might respond to different environmental drivers. My work with the Ice-Sheet and Sea-Level System Model (ISSM) has revealed a potential vulnerability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to climate warming: the impact of thawing at the iceâ€“bed interface on mass loss. In areas where the bed is frozen but near the melting point, even a small increase in basal temperature can sharply reduce basal friction, triggering additional ice discharge. <a href="/publications/#publication-2022-Dawson">This study</a> was featured in <a href="https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/are-we-missing-crucial-component-sea-level-rise" target="_blank">Stanford Sustainability News</a>, highlighting the potential for new, previously overlooked contributions to sea-level rise.</p>
