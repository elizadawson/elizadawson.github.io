    <p>I specialize in integrating geophysical observations into ice sheet models, using a range of methods — including inverse modeling, data assimilation, and targeted sensitivity analysis — to translate geophysical observations into physically meaningful model constraints. This two-way connection is essential: observations are only as powerful as the insight they provide to models because models are what allow us to project future mass loss, instability, and contributions to sea-level rise. My work couples radar and other field data with process-based simulations, ensuring that modeled ice sheet behavior is anchored in observations while also guiding new data collection to where it will most improve predictions.</p>

    <p><a href="/publications/#publication-2022-Dawson">My research in <em>Nature Communications</em></a> is an example of how targeted modeling experiments can identify which observations will be most valuable for ice flow projections. By testing the sensitivity of Antarctic mass loss to basal thermal state in the Ice-Sheet and Sea-Level System Model (ISSM), I found that in regions where the bed is frozen but close to melting, even a small temperature increase can drastically reduce basal friction, accelerating ice discharge. This study, featured in <a href="https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/are-we-missing-crucial-component-sea-level-rise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stanford Sustainability News</a>, shows how better constraints on basal thermal conditions are key to improving future sea-level rise projections.</p>
