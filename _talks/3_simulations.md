I also utilize numerical models to simulate ice sheet dynamics. These models are essential for predicting future cryospheric changes via simulating how ice sheets might respond to various environmental factors, particularly climate change. For instance, my work with the Ice-Sheet and Sea-Level System Model (ISSM) has uncovered a potential vulnerability of the Antarctic ice sheet due to climate warmingâ€”the impact of thawing at the ice-bed interface on ice-sheet mass loss. In regions where the bed is currently frozen but close to thawing, just a slight increase in basal temperature could significantly reduce basal friction, leading to additional mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet.
