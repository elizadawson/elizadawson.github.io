I believe that future breakthroughs in understanding cryospheric change will come from bridging methodology and scientific approaches from the subdiscipline to cross-discipline scale. As someone who has worked across many scientific and methodological disciplines, I have noticed a lack of cross-disciplinary interaction. Within the field of glaciology, observations and modeling studies are typically conducted by separate groups. Within the greater polar geoscience community, there is little crossover between glaciologists, oceanographers, and climate scientists.

My research challenges these divisions. I have recently been awarded grants from both NOAA and the NSF to develop novel ways to combine ice sheet models and geophysical observations to unlock greater insights about the Antarctic ice sheet subsurface and improve simulations of the ice sheet evolution. I am currently developing terrestrial radioglaciology approaches in collaboration with planetary science experts that utilize recent developments in planetary radio science. During my time at Stanford, my research extended beyond the Geophysics Department, as I worked with oceanography professor Earle Wilson to investigate connections between Southern Ocean forcing and vulnerable regions of the East Antarctic ice sheet. Furthermore, my undergraduate education is in Atmospheric Science, which included research in arctic climatology. My perspective is that interdisciplinary research will provide the missing links for understanding ice sheet sensitivity and improving projections of sea level rise.
