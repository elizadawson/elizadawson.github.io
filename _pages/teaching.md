My teaching experience spans undergraduate, graduate, and field-based geoscience across multiple institutions. I have served as a teaching assistant for courses in radar, seismic, gravity, and magnetic methods, delivered guest lectures, and taught field geophysics in environments ranging from the Mojave Desert to the Arctic. Alongside classroom and field instruction, I mentor students on research projects and contribute to community teaching development and service. These experiences shape my approach to hands-on learning, peer-to-peer engagement, and supporting students as they connect classroom learnings with real-world problems.

### Teaching Snapshot
- Undergraduate and graduate courses at Stanford and the University Centre in Svalbard
- Field instruction in the Mojave Desert, Svalbard, and Iceland
- Graduate Teaching Liaison at Stanford University
- Service on the AGU Cryosphere Section Committee
- Coordinator of Cryosphere Outstanding Student Presentation Awards (OSPA)
- Guest lectures on topics ranging from radar methods to ice and climate dynamics

### Student Mentoring
I have mentored undergraduate and graduate students on projects ranging from radar data processing to ice sheet and ocean modeling. My mentees have presented at AGU, advanced to graduate programs, and secured competitive fellowships. I emphasize guided yet open-ended research questions, reproducible workflows, and skill-building that prepare students for both academic and industry paths.

### Teaching Development & Service
At Stanford, I served as a Graduate Teaching Liaison for the School of Sustainability, where I organized pedagogy workshops, coached new TAs, and helped build an inclusive classroom culture. I also serve on the American Geophysical Union’s Cryosphere Section Committee and lead the Outstanding Student Presentation Awards (OSPA) program, providing students with presentation feedback and recognition of achievement.

## Field Course Highlights

I teach and mentor students in field geophysics, helping them connect theory to practice in challenging environments from deserts to polar regions.

### Arctic Geophysics at the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS)
I taught in the Arctic Geophysics Course at UNIS, introducing students to radar surveying with ground and UAV systems and assisting with active seismic work on glaciers and permafrost terrain.

### Mojave Desert Field Geophysics (Stanford)
As a teaching assistant for Stanford’s introductory geophysics course, I guided students through radar, gravity, and magnetic surveys in California’s Mojave Desert, including data acquisition, processing, and interpretation.
