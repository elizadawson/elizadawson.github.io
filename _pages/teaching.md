I have contributed to undergraduate, graduate, and field-based geoscience education across multiple institutions. As a teaching assistant, I have supported lectures and led practical sessions on radar, seismic, gravity, and magnetic methods. I have also taught in the field in challenging environments ranging from the desert to the Arctic. In addition, I seek out opportunities to strengthen teaching resources. During my PhD at Stanford, I served as a Graduate Teaching Liaison, leading pedagogy workshops, mentoring new TAs, and fostering an inclusive classroom culture. These experiences have shaped my focus on hands-on teaching, peer-to-peer engagement, and mentoring students as they connect classroom learnings with real-world problems.

## Teaching in the Arctic at UNIS, Svalbard

I taught in the Arctic Geophysics Course at the University Centre in Svalbard, Norway (UNIS), introducing students to radar surveying with ground and UAV systems and assisting with active seismic work across a glacier.

## Field Geophysics Instruction in the Mojave Desert

As a teaching assistant for Stanford’s undergraduate introduction to geophysics course, I taught students how to conduct radar, gravity, and magnetic surveys in California’s Mojave Desert, guiding them through data acquisition, processing, and interpretation.
