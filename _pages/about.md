My research explores the processes driving the evolution of Earthâ€™s ice sheets and their potential to cause widespread, unstable ice loss, leading to global sea level rise. My work focuses on subglacial and englacial ice sheet conditions, along with feedback mechanisms that regulate ice flow but are challenging to measure or model due to the uncertainties posed by this vast, remote, and harsh environment.

To address these challenges, I am developing methods that combine advancements across Earth, planetary, and data sciences to integrate observational and modeling approaches for polar geoscience problems. My aim is to deepen our understanding of ice sheet dynamics in the face of climate change and to identify emerging loci of ice loss and sea-level rise potential.
