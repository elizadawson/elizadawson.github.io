My research explores the underlying processes that shape the evolution of Earthâ€™s ice sheets, particularly those that could lead to unstable and widespread ice loss resulting in sea level rise. I am especially focused on how subglacial and englacial conditions influence ice flow and ice sheet stability. Subsurface conditions are critical in modulating ice flow; however, the basal environment is challenging to measure directly due to the ice sheet's remote location, vast size, and harsh conditions. As a result, the future evolution of the ice sheet in response to subsurface changes remains highly uncertain.

To address these challenges, I am innovating methods that combine recent advancements across earth, planetary, and data science disciplines with the goal of synthesizing observations and models to answer polar geoscience problems. Through this work, I seek to improve our understanding of ice sheet dynamics in the face of climate change and identify emerging loci of ice loss and sea-level rise contribution.
