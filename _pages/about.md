I am a [NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellow](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc/current-awards-alumni) studying the processes that govern the evolution of Earthâ€™s ice sheets and their potential to drive unstable ice loss and sea level rise. My research brings together observational datasets and ice sheet models to better understand how subglacial and englacial conditions influence ice dynamics across Antarctica and Greenland.

I focus on developing methods that combine geophysical observations and numerical modeling to quantify processes that are difficult to observe directly. These include thermal and hydrologic feedbacks beneath ice sheets that can strongly modulate ice flow but remain poorly constrained due to the inaccessibility of the polar environment.

I completed my PhD in the [Stanford Radioglaciology Lab](https://www.radioglaciology.com/) under the supervision of Dr. Dusty Schroeder, where I developed techniques for extracting physical insights from radar sounding data in conjunction with ice sheet modeling. I am currently hosted by Dr. Winnie Chu at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://glacier-geophys.eas.gatech.edu/), where I continue to connect Earth science and data science to improve predictive models of ice sheet change in a warming climate.
