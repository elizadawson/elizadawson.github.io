I am a [NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellow](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc/current-awards-alumni) studying the processes that will shape the future of Earth’s ice sheets and their contribution to global sea level rise. I am inspired by the intersection of exploration, discovery, and the urgent need to understand Earth’s changing ice.

As a postdoctoral researcher hosted by Dr. Winnie Chu at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://glacier-geophys.eas.gatech.edu/), I link geophysical observations with numerical models to investigate hard-to-measure processes that are critical for predicting ice flow accelerations and instability. I completed my PhD in the [Stanford Radioglaciology Lab](https://www.radioglaciology.com/) under Dr. Dusty Schroeder, where I developed techniques to extract physical insights from radar sounding data and used ice sheet models to reveal subsurface conditions.
