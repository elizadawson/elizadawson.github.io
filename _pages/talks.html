  I study the processes that control polar ice sheet flow and their impact on global sea level rise. My work builds quantitative links between what we can observe in the ice today, especially with radar sounding, and what ice sheet models need to better project future change.

  <strong>"Predicting the future of Antarctica and Greenland starts with characterizing what is happening deep beneath the ice surface."</strong><br>
  Conditions at the ice sheet base greatly influence ice flow and stability, yet they remain poorly understood and underrepresented in models. I work at the intersection of computational geophysics, numerical modeling, and climate science to close this gap, improving predictions of ice loss and sea level rise in a warming world.

  <strong>"Advancing our understanding of cryospheric change requires breaking through disciplinary silos."</strong><br>
  In glaciology, observational and modeling efforts too often operate in isolation, with limited exchange between glaciologists, geophysicists, and climate scientists. My work challenges these divisions by integrating tools and perspectives across fields to address complex, system-scale questions.

    Radar sounding provides the only continent scale view of the ice sheet subsurface, from internal layering to the ice bed. I develop analysis methods that turn radar echoes into physical information about temperature, ice properties, and basal conditions, with uncertainty estimates that make the results usable in modeling. For example, I built a statistical framework to classify frozen and thawed bed conditions beneath the Wilkes Subglacial Basin outflow, including confidence for each classification, producing one of the first radar based thermal state assessments for a region central to East Antarctica stability. I also develop attenuation based constraints from radar returned power that can be compared with borehole and model based estimates.

  Turning observations into model ready constraints
</h2>

<div style="margin-top: 0.5em; font-size: 0.85em;">
  <p>
    A key challenge in ice sheet science is converting geophysical observations into quantitative constraints that ice flow models can use, especially for basal and englacial conditions that are rarely measured directly. My approach is to develop inversion and probabilistic frameworks that translate geophysical measurements into model inputs, including basal friction and thermal state, and use that to quantify what is strongly constrained by data and what remains most uncertain.

  Ice flow simulations that identify key data needs
</h2>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between; margin-top: 0.5em;">
  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px; font-size: 0.85em;">
    <p>
      I use process based modeling to test how sensitive ice loss is to poorly observed basal conditions and to identify which measurements will most reduce projection uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="/publications/#publication-2022-Dawson">My research in <em>Nature Communications</em></a> used ISSM to show that modest basal warming in near melt regions can greatly reduce basal friction and increase ice discharge in parts of East Antarctica often treated as stable. This links basal thermal constraints to where future ice loss can accelerate and helps identify regions where observations are most needed.

  Cross system perspective spanning cryosphere, climate, and ocean forcing
</h2>

<div style="margin-top: 0.5em; font-size: 0.85em;">
  <p>
    Ice sheets respond to both internal basal physics and external forcing. I work with oceanographers and climate scientists to connect the observed basal state to ice shelf melt, grounding zone risk and ocean and atmospheric drivers, using geophysical constraints to guide idealized and targeted modeling.
