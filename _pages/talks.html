<h3>Guiding Perspective</h3>

<blockquote style="font-style: italic; border-left: 4px solid #ccc; padding-left: 1em; margin: 1.5em 0;">
  <strong>"Advancing our understanding of cryospheric change requires breaking down disciplinary silos."</strong><br>
  In glaciology, observational and modeling efforts too often operate in isolation, with limited exchange between glaciologists, geophysicists, and climate scientists. My work challenges these divisions by integrating tools and perspectives across fields to address complex, system-scale questions.
