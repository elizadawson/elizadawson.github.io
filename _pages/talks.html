  <strong>"Predicting the future of polar ice sheets and global sea level requires connecting what we can observe today with how ice will evolve tomorrow."</strong><br>
  My work builds new ways to turn geophysical signals into physical understanding, from radar echoes deep inside ice to models that project ice loss and sea-level rise under a changing climate."

  <strong>"Predicting the future of Antarctica and Greenland starts with characterizing what is happening deep beneath the ice surface."</strong><br>
  Conditions at the ice sheet base greatly influence ice flow and stability, yet they remain poorly understood and underrepresented in models. I work at the intersection of computational geophysics, numerical modeling, and climate science to close this gap, improving predictions of ice loss and sea level rise in a warming world.

  <strong>"Advancing our understanding of cryospheric change requires breaking through disciplinary silos."</strong><br>
  In glaciology, observational and modeling efforts too often operate in isolation, with limited exchange between glaciologists, geophysicists, and climate scientists. My work challenges these divisions by integrating tools and perspectives across fields to address complex, system-scale questions.
